Spider-Man (2002), directed by Sam Raimi, is the first film in the Spider-Man trilogy and tells the origin story of Peter Parker, a high school student who gains spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. Here’s a detailed look at the plot:

Plot Summary:
Peter Parker's Transformation:
Peter Parker (played by Tobey Maguire) is a shy, nerdy high school student living in New York City. He lives with his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), who raised him after the death of his parents. Peter has a secret crush on his classmate, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), but she’s dating the popular and athletic Flash Thompson (Joe Manganiello).

One day, Peter goes on a school trip to a genetics lab where he is bitten by a genetically altered spider. The bite grants him superhuman strength, agility, and the ability to cling to walls. He soon discovers that he has acquired spider-like powers, such as enhanced vision, reflexes, and the ability to sense danger (his "spider-sense").

Becoming Spider-Man:
At first, Peter uses his powers for personal gain, entering a wrestling match to earn money for a new car. However, his pursuit of money leads to a pivotal moment when he allows a thief to escape. That thief later kills Peter’s Uncle Ben during a robbery, deeply affecting Peter. Feeling responsible for his uncle's death, Peter vows to use his powers for good, embracing the mantle of Spider-Man.

Spider-Man vs. Green Goblin:
Meanwhile, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), the head of the Oscorp company and the father of Peter’s best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), becomes the film’s antagonist. After a failed experiment to enhance human performance, Norman exposes himself to an unstable chemical formula, which transforms him into the dangerous Green Goblin. This new persona possesses incredible strength, intelligence, and a deranged mind, making him a formidable enemy.

The Green Goblin begins attacking both Spider-Man and those close to him. Harry, unaware of his father’s evil alter ego, is caught in the crossfire and becomes angry at Peter for being Spider-Man, believing him to be the cause of his father’s downfall.

The Final Showdown:
The film culminates in a showdown between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin. The Green Goblin kidnaps Mary Jane and threatens to kill her unless Spider-Man reveals his identity. In the end, Spider-Man is able to defeat the Green Goblin, but not before Norman dies in a confrontation with his own glider. Before his death, Norman asks Peter to protect his son Harry from the truth.

Peter's Personal Struggles:
The film ends with Peter making a personal sacrifice. He realizes that being Spider-Man means keeping his loved ones at a distance to protect them. He decides to remain the masked hero, distancing himself from Mary Jane, who has developed feelings for him. In the final scene, Mary Jane confesses her love for Spider-Man, but Peter, to keep her safe, decides to stay away, despite his own feelings for her.

Themes and Character Development:
Responsibility: The movie heavily explores the theme of responsibility, as Peter learns that "with great power comes great responsibility." This lesson shapes his journey as he decides to embrace his role as Spider-Man.

Identity and Sacrifice: Peter struggles with balancing his personal life as Peter Parker and his duties as Spider-Man. This inner conflict becomes one of the key emotional struggles of the character.

Hero’s Journey: Peter’s transformation into a hero is depicted as a classic hero’s journey, from gaining powers and learning to use them, to facing great personal loss, and ultimately rising to the challenge of protecting his city.

Spider-Man (2002) was well-received for its engaging character development, exciting action sequences, and emotional depth, making it a landmark superhero film that helped pave the way for future superhero franchises.
